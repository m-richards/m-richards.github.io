I&rsquo;m a full-time cynic, part-time pesimist and view New Years resolutions with a
generous dose of skepticism, thinking most likely these are happy lies we tell ourselves to sleep better at night,
before the fade into obscurity a few weeks later. Yet here I find myself, on the second day of 2023 finally acting on a
blogging idea I&rsquo;ve been mulling over for a fair while now. There&rsquo;s also a pragmatic element to the timing, it&rsquo;s
definitely easier to carve out the time to start something new while away from work for a while. But the timing is hard
to ignore, perhaps it&rsquo;s auspicious. Or perhaps like other resolutions this will lie forgotten in a few weeks time, only
for me to hurriedly remove all evidence from the internet whenever I realise. Time will tell.</p><h1 id=motivations>Motivations</h1><p>I think when starting on a body of writing (even something as disjoint as a series of blog posts) it&rsquo;s sensible to
clearly lay out some intentions and purpose for the time invested. Especially in a context like this, where (hopefully)
I&rsquo;ll keep contributing over time, and might forget some of the original inspriation. So here&rsquo;s a few things I&rsquo;m hoping
to achieve by writing here. Some of them are pragmatic, others are a little more open ended.</p><p>In no particular order:</p><ul><li>Generate some artefacts I can refer / refer others to for setting up software / processes (and convert some of my
github gists into something a little more fully fledged)</li><li>Document things I&rsquo;ve learnt, tools I&rsquo;ve tried</li><li>As a prompt to try out new tools/ tech I&rsquo;ve heard about (like <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> which I&rsquo;d not used until
setting this up)</li><li>Musings about software development practices, and how that fits into the world of consulting / transport modelling</li><li>To keep writing, as these days this is not something I do a lot in my work</li><li>To keep teaching, as although I no longer do any university tutoring, this is still something I&rsquo;m engaged and
interested in (and written form seems the most pragmatic way to apply that right now)</li><li>To carve out my own little corner of the internet. More on this below.</li></ul><h1 id=audience>Audience</h1><p>In all of this, the primary audience is intended to be me. Something I debated in starting this was whether I could just
write myself some nice markdown and put it on github, self host the website only or use something like
<a href=https://joplinapp.org/>Joplin</a> or <a href=https://archivy.github.io/>Archivy</a> and never reveal anything to the internet at
large. Right now the key reason for sharing is convenience. I can reach this site with any computer/tablet/phone that
has access to the internet. Not only that but a public webpage is distributable - I can pass a link on to anyone to
view. In some sense that might limit what I would post (it certainly means I won&rsquo;t be putting much personal reflection
here) but on the other hand, I&rsquo;m not afraid of posting on these topics either. I might not be an expert in lots of
things, but I don&rsquo;t claim to be one either.</p><h1 id=addendum>Addendum</h1><h2 id=whats-in-a-name>What&rsquo;s in a name</h2><p>Successful blogs should probably have catchy, clever names that reflect their content well. Catchy, clever names are not
something I do very well. I also don&rsquo;t have a well defined scope for what I want to write about. So placeholder title
will suffice for now (and perhaps for longer)</p><h2 id=non-goals>Non-goals</h2><p>It&rsquo;s probably worth trying to declare certain things out of scope for this blog. The most obvious in my mind is delving
into front end web development. Writing a blog (even as a static site, which admittedly is a lot less complication than
most applications on the internet), there&rsquo;s perhaps a temptation to unpack and fully understand how the markdown I&rsquo;m
writing here gets converted into something that looks pretty on the internet. It&rsquo;s certainly something I could look
into. But I only have finite time, and this blog in itself isn&rsquo;t meant to be a huge time sink, and I have enough
interesting things to look into in my spare time without going down the rabbit hole of learning a framework and
toolchain that will be out of date within 6 months.</p><p>The other non-goal which is clear to me is to preserve a perfect historical record for the world to see (). I fully
intend to go back and update posts I write with better descriptions, updated technology, corrections and elaborations.
Where appropriate I&rsquo;ll acknowledge that the content has changed. Bearing in mind I am my primary audience (at least for
now), I want this to be something I can refer to regularly, rather than a relic of things that might have been useful
once upon a time. Realistically, if this is successful, I&rsquo;ll probably end up with a mix, I&rsquo;d like to think that what I
work on and how I accomplish things will evolve over time, which might necessitate that some things are out of date. But
that&rsquo;s okay too.</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span class=item-title>Author</span>
