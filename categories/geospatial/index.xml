With pandas 2.0 (or perhaps a minor patch after), pandas switched to using a meson based build backend - and this updates the instructions accordingly. This post draws from my previous one, plus elements of this post, with some of my own fixes added.</description></item><item><title>Tips for success installing python packages</title><link>https://m-richards.github.io/post/geospatial_package_installation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 12:09:28 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://m-richards.github.io/post/geospatial_package_installation/</guid><description>Although python has a functional story around packaging, there are plenty of footguns for people who only occasionally dabble with package management. This situation is fairly common in my line of work, when a project is started, the project team get set up with working developer environments, and then happily forget about packaging problems for the next x months until the next project starts. So this is a quick reference I hope to point people to the next time I get &amp;ldquo;my python environment isn&amp;rsquo;t working / I can&amp;rsquo;t install package x questions&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Setting up a pandas/main environment for GeoPandas</title><link>https://m-richards.github.io/post/geopandas_dev_env/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 18:05:38 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://m-richards.github.io/post/geopandas_dev_env/</guid><description>Although it&amp;rsquo;s not something I tend to advertise very often, I&amp;rsquo;m a maintainer for GeoPandas which is the de-facto standard tool for tabular geospatial analysis in Python. My contributions here wax and wane here with the amount of free time and mental space I have to volunteer. As part of this, we keep the software in sync with developments in pandas, and our CI tests against pandas/main. From time to time (more frequently with the upcoming pandas 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
