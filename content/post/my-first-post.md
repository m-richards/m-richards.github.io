Generally, I'm not one for cliches. I'm a full-time cynic, part-time pesimist and view New Years resolutions with a
generous dose of skepticism, thinking most likely these are happy lies we tell ourselves to sleep better at night,
before the fade into obscurity a few weeks later. Yet here I find myself, on the second day of 2023 finally acting on a
blogging idea I've been mulling over for a fair while now. There's also a pragmatic element to the timing, it's
definitely easier to carve out the time to start something new while away from work for a while. But the timing is hard
to ignore, perhaps it's auspicious. Or perhaps like other resolutions this will lie forgotten in a few weeks time, only
for me to hurriedly remove all evidence from the internet whenever I realise. Time will tell.

# Motivations

I think when starting on a body of writing (even something as disjoint as a series of blog posts) it's sensible to
clearly lay out some intentions and purpose for the time invested. Especially in a context like this, where (hopefully)
I'll keep contributing over time, and might forget some of the original inspriation. So here's a few things I'm hoping
to achieve by writing here. Some of them are pragmatic, others are a little more open ended.

In no particular order:

- Generate some artefacts I can refer / refer others to for setting up software / processes (and convert some of my
  github gists into something a little more fully fledged)
- Document things I've learnt, tools I've tried
- As a prompt to try out new tools/ tech I've heard about (like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which I'd not used until
  setting this up)
- Musings about software development practices, and how that fits into the world of consulting / transport modelling
- To keep writing, as these days this is not something I do a lot in my work
- To keep teaching, as although I no longer do any university tutoring, this is still something I'm engaged and
  interested in (and written form seems the most pragmatic way to apply that right now)
- To carve out my own little corner of the internet. More on this below.

# Audience

In all of this, the primary audience is intended to be me. Something I debated in starting this was whether I could just
write myself some nice markdown and put it on github, self host the website only or use something like
[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) or [Archivy](https://archivy.github.io/) and never reveal anything to the internet at
large. Right now the key reason for sharing is convenience. I can reach this site with any computer/tablet/phone that
has access to the internet. Not only that but a public webpage is distributable - I can pass a link on to anyone to
view. In some sense that might limit what I would post (it certainly means I won't be putting much personal reflection
here) but on the other hand, I'm not afraid of posting on these topics either. I might not be an expert in lots of
things, but I don't claim to be one either.

# Addendum

## What's in a name

Successful blogs should probably have catchy, clever names that reflect their content well. Catchy, clever names are not
something I do very well. I also don't have a well defined scope for what I want to write about. So placeholder title
will suffice for now (and perhaps for longer)

## Non-goals

It's probably worth trying to declare certain things out of scope for this blog. The most obvious in my mind is delving
into front end web development. Writing a blog (even as a static site, which admittedly is a lot less complication than
most applications on the internet), there's perhaps a temptation to unpack and fully understand how the markdown I'm
writing here gets converted into something that looks pretty on the internet. It's certainly something I could look
into. But I only have finite time, and this blog in itself isn't meant to be a huge time sink, and I have enough
interesting things to look into in my spare time without going down the rabbit hole of learning a framework and
toolchain that will be out of date within 6 months.

The other non-goal which is clear to me is to preserve a perfect historical record for the world to see. I fully intend
to go back and update posts I write with better descriptions, updated technology, corrections and elaborations. Where
appropriate I'll acknowledge that the content has changed. Bearing in mind I am my primary audience (at least for now),
I want this to be something I can refer to regularly, rather than a relic of things that might have been useful once
upon a time. Realistically, if this is successful, I'll probably end up with a mix, I'd like to think that what I work
on and how I accomplish things will evolve over time, which might necessitate that some things are out of date. But
that's okay too.
